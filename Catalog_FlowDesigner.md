- HUGE install base
- with very large trained developer base. In-depth custom development training.
### 3.1. Workflow and Flow Designer Pro and Con

- Both require serious training to master.
- Workflow has a scratchpad variable
- Workflow has loopback to previous step
- Flow designer has data pills, but cannot expad JSON or non-GlideRecord objects.
- Deployment is the same for both(Update sets, scoped applications) 
- A question about the worfkflow will be taken away --> Answer would be NO. 13:49
